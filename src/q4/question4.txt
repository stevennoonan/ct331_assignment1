Q4 a)
Because this is an implementation of a singly linked list you must first reverse the order of the linked list to traverse tail to head.
This therefore requires more memory than traversing head to tail as extra computations must be completed.

b) 
The structure of the linked list could be improved by changing it to a doubly linked list. I.e. have nodes that point forwards and backwards.
This will be less memory intensive as reversing the linked list is not necessary as you can start at the tail node and iterate backwards through the list.
